# Homework Two 

Edit the supplied TeX file to include your solutions and push the result to the 
repo by the due date. 

## Editing and submitting files

This works the same as with [Homework 0](https://github.com/UofSC-Fall-2021-Math-738-001/homework-0)

One new wrinkle is that you will be collaborating in teams on the assignment. Git is built for 
robust collaboration. 

When working in a team, you will inevitably want to incorporate others' changes into your local repo. 

Some advice on working with git and not against it: 
- When you are done working, make sure to `git push` your changes.
- When you start work, do a `git pull`. 
- If you push and find the repo has changed out from underneath you, you will pull to see 
    if git can merge the changes automatically. If not, you will need to edit the diff file 
    yourself. Some 
    [notes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line)
    from GitHub on doing this.
